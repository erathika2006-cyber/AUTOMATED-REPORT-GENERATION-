AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION – PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Automated Report Generation is an important application of Python programming that helps in converting raw data into structured and professional reports without manual effort. In this project, a Python script is developed to read data from a file, analyze it, and automatically generate a formatted PDF report. This approach improves efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in reporting, which is widely required in industries such as business analytics, education, finance, and human resources.

The project uses a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file as the input data source. CSV files are commonly used because they are simple, lightweight, and easy to handle using Python. The data file contains basic information such as names and numerical values (for example, marks or performance scores). The Python library Pandas is used to read the CSV file and perform data analysis. Pandas provides powerful data manipulation features that make calculations like averages, totals, and summaries very easy and reliable.

After reading the data, the script performs basic analysis by calculating the average of the numerical column. This analysis step demonstrates how raw data can be transformed into meaningful information. Instead of manually calculating values, the program automatically processes the data, reducing human errors and saving time. Such automation is especially useful when working with large datasets.
